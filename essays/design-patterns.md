For someone born less than 30 years ago, it's difficult to think of a time without computers. But this era we occupy is far different than any mankind's ever seen. And in learning to deal with the new reality computers have brought us, we seek to reason with, explain, and categorize computing itself into terms we're familiar with. The very concept of design patterns, generalized approaches to certain kinds of software problems, stems from our need to recognize and classify patterns we see and to make sense of them. Software is a burgeoning field, and the properties of the software must be considered when we think about broad topics such as design patterns, and consider their ultimate usefulness.

## The Purpose of Software
Software can serve many purposes, as a tool for profession, recreation, or even art. The scope in which design patterns can be applied is wide, but the usefulness and dangers of design patterns varies with the application.

Design patterns, in the scope of recreation or art, can be extremely helpful, reducing development time at the cost of potential efficiency or correctness. I've applied these design patterns in my own work, when I simply needed a way to begin approaching a conceptual problem for a video game. Sometimes they work as intended, easing my burden and offering knowledge I can take forward. Sometimes they break everything, or make matters worse, either due to misapplication or misunderstanding. But one must consider, should the end creative output satisfy the creator or the consumer, does it ultimately matter whether the software is truly efficient or correct? Some of the bigger problems are thus skirted in non-professional work, but the danger therein lies in the potential for those same applications to echo into professional work, their problems forgotten simply because at the time, they did not matter.

In professional work, many of the same benefits can be obtained, but greater care must be taken in its implementations. Why wouldn't one borrow from the wisdom of our metaphorical ancestors? But this path is fraught with danger, as misapplication and misunderstanding of the patterns can lead to great difficulty. Problems that were approached with a pattern in order to reduce initial workload instead increases it further along, as systems fall apart in a catastrophe of architectural mishaps: as you sow technical debt in your haste to borrow the knowledge of ancients, so shall you reap the pain of not understanding what exactly it is you are doing.

## The Purity of Software
Edsger Dijkstra, godfather of a host of computing principles and algorithms, [had written and lectured extensively on his perception of computing](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~EWD/transcriptions/EWD10xx/EWD1036.html). His view behind computing and programming boiled down to scientific discipline with the purity transcending mathematics and logic, decrying the messy layers humans had built upon in order to make sense of it. He took issue with those who viewed programming as a craft, and those who took the name of "software engineer", a field that to that point, had only been self-contradictory, existing without discipline or the scientific backing that True Computing Science would provide. 

If one were to follow this view of software and computing, design patterns are an absolute poison. Recognition of patterns, without the absolute correctness or exactness of a scientific discipline, would be akin to a common craftsman carrying tools with which to poke and prod at a problem. With a weak understanding of the nature of those tools, it might be extremely tempting to treat any problem you see as deserving of a hammer. But we know, from the tens of millions of programmers that exist today, that these people are a minority, whose lofty dreams haven't found a place to root in reality quite yet.

## The Potential of Software

Ultimately, the true use and worth of design patterns lies in those who use them, and how they decide to apply them. Software developers will continue to draw from the knowledge of the past, perhaps without a rigorous understanding of it, and sometimes blowing up in their face. Software engineers, but only those who truly attempt to apply the profession of engineering to computing itself, might be more particular, more careful, and more responsible in their uses, but they too will eventually make a mistake that will need to be repaid.

Those that view computing as a pure science - whose methods and means might eventually be distilled into a proper discipline or applied into tools a craftsman might use - would likely look on in disgust or horror. But until these people can overwhelm the common knowledge and sheer volume of those who don't care, software development as we know it will rule the day, and design patterns will continue to live on, for better or worse.
